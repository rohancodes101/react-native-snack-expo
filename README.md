# react-native-snack-expo
This repository contains small React Native code snippets and experiments that I am learning while following along with tutorials.
Each concept or example is kept in a separate file for better organization and practice.

The code here is based on lessons from Hitesh Choudhary's YouTube channel, where I am currently learning React Native development with Expo.
